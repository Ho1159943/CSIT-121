<p class="right">I chose this recipe even though I have never tried it before. The story behind it makes up for that. This recipe can actually be found on Christine Hammill's gravestone in Ferndale, next to her husband Richard. <br>
Being that it is on a gravestone, you may assume the couple is dead. Funny enough, they are still alive. <br>
Occupied gravesite or not, this recipe has gotten the attention of many online users. There are a few social media accounts that test gravestone recipies, and that is how I found this one! <br>
By all accounts, it is more than just "good". I look forward to trying out the recipe myself one day.</p>
